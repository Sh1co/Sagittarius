Sagittarius is a game development framework for the Godot engine, optimized for top-down 2D games. It offers powerful features for streamlining game development and creating immersive games quickly and efficiently.

## Getting started

To use Sagittarius, you'll need to clone the repository and build your project on it. Unfortunately, importing is not available yet.

To create your first level with Sagittarius:

1. Create a root scene and set its type to SGame
2. Create another scene and set its type to SGamePlayLevel
3. Add the new scene to the level list in SGame

Congratulations, you now have a game with a single level! If you'd like to add a main menu, simply drag and drop the SMainMenu template scene from the Scenes folder to the main menu field on SGame.

You can also the check the sample games for more details on the implementation.
